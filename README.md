# San-Francisco-Crime_Classification

This project consist of Predictive Model that predict for San Francisco Crime Category using Random Forest, Neural Network and Naive Bayes.

The main aim of the project is to predict the Crime Category that happened in San Francisco using the past historical data. This project served as a proof of concept for framming a Supervised Classification Task using Random Forest, Neural Network and Naive Bayes. It is one of the mini project during my study in Master of Data Science. Feel free to drop a comment and feedback.
